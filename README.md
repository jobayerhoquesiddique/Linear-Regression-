📊 Data Pipeline
	1.	Data Preprocessing
	•	Loads dataset (e.g., Salary Data.csv).
	•	Creates polynomial features if necessary.
	•	Splits data into training and test sets.
	•	Standardizes the feature set using StandardScaler.
	2.	Machine Learning Models
	•	Linear Regression → Predicts target values based on input features.
	•	Lasso Regression → Regularized model to reduce overfitting.
	•	Polynomial Regression → Fits non-linear relationships.
	3.	Web App Interface
	•	Uses Streamlit for an interactive experience.
	•	Provides a slider for user input.
	•	Displays real-time predictions.
	•	Shows scatter plot with trendline and residual histogram.
